## Welcome to the Try .NET repo.

Try .NET provides developers and content authors with tools to create interactive experiences.

There are two different Try .NET interactive experiences:
* The web experience powered by Blazor (as seen on [Essential C#](https://essentialcsharp.com/hello-world#hello-world))
* Interactive documentation with Markdown for .NET Core with the [dotnet try global tool](DotNetTry.md).

### Online, powered by Blazor

EssentialCSharp.com uses Try .NET to create interactive code listings. Users can run and edit code all in the browser.

_**Please Note**: At the moment, the Try .NET online (`trydotnet.js API`) is currently only used internally at IntelliTect as seen on EssentialCSharp.com(https://essentialcsharp.com/hello-world#hello-world)._

### Interactive .NET Core documentation with the `dotnet try` global tool

Try .NET enables .NET developers to create interactive markdown files.
To make your markdown files interactive, you will need the [.NET Core 3.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0), the `dotnet try` global tool and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) / [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or any other editor of your choice).
